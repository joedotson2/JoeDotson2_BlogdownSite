<div id="here-we-go" class="section level1">
<h1>Here We Go</h1>
<p>First I have to make a shoutout to everyone in the rstats community. Without the insane dedication to open source, and endless committment to helping others, projects like these would be much harder.</p>
<p>That’s my main inspiration for creating this site. If I can make one thing easier for one other newcomer to the world of R, I will have made an effective contribution to this community.</p>

<div id="what-to-expect" class="section level1">
<h1>What To Expect</h1>
<p>Here I will discuss my adventures in life, politics, and data analysis. For the most part, expect exploratory data analysis, tips, and tricks. The main purpose of this site is to outline problems that I have come up against when working with R, and how I solved them. I am by no means an expert, just a regular guy, a perpetual noob, trying to make it.</p>
